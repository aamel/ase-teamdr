Final Project - Teamdr (Javaplay)
—————————————————————————

##Synopsis:

Not knowing anyone in your classes can be a huge source of anxiety, especially if a significant portion of the class’s assignments are team projects. Teamdr, which is a pun on Tindr, is a web application that helps students in classes with team projects find group members that they can work with.
To use our application, users are expected to provide a username, password, and optionally their email address. Each student’s profile will also show the list of classes they are taking. They have the option of conducting teammate searches for any class that they are currently enrolled in. For each class, users can view the profiles, excluding their contact information, of other students and teams. For each team the user searches for, the user can view the team’s name, the list of team members, and the description each team member provided for their profile (ex. “strong preference for teaming up with fellow seniors”). Similar to Tindr, the user has the option to “swipe left” or “swipe right” on any given student. If there is a “match,” where two users “swipe right” for each other, these matched users can see each other’s contact info (if provided). Users who have formed part of a team for a class will be displayed together in the search results. In order to accept a person into a team, at least one person from the team must swipe right on that person. To merge two teams, at least one member from each team has to swipe right on the other team. 
Finally, users have the option of giving a rating of 1-5 (from terrible to excellent) to any of their teammates. This rating is permanent and public, and works like a recommendation feature - each user’s rating is an indication of their quality as a team member.
					
Note: We’re not actually implementing “swipe left” and “swipe right” literally. They are buttons in our app. But we are using this terminology to explain a key functionality for our app.
