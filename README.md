# Teamdr
Tasks to do:

Melanie: 
Sign in/sign up: Homepage
Sign in/sign up is on every single page
  
Bailey:
When you log in, you see Profile page which includes list of classes (add/delete classes here) & what teams you are in (ex. you can see what team you are in in the classes drop down menu)
Profile, search for and create classes
  
Anfal & Amel:
Team search page (one per class), this lets you go through users and swipe left/right - you only see one Team at a time

Tips: If DB is storing garbage values, do activator clean, activator run.
Ex. {"username":"1","password":null} when right value should be {"username":"turtles","password":"flops"}
